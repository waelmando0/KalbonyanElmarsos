	<summary><strong>Iteration Chapter Quiz</strong></summary>
	<strong>Why would you create a loop in Python with the while keyword rather than the for keyword?</strong>
    <br>
	 The <strong>while</strong> keyword allows you to create a loop that continues until the program arrives at a certain state.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>In Python, which keyword can you use to create a loop?</strong>
	<br>
	 In Python, you can use a `for` statement to loop through each item in a list.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What is another term for code that iterates?</strong>
	<br>
	 Code that iterates is often described as a loop, because the process moves from beginning to end and then starts over again at the beginning

	<summary><strong>External Code Chapter Quiz</strong></summary>
	<strong>Why do developers sometimes use shared code in their programs?</strong>
    <br>
	 It can become tedious to have to rewrite code to solve the same problem over and over.
    <br>
	 Shared code is generally optimized to perform a basic programming task so other developers don't have to write the same code over and over.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How is a framework different from a library</strong>
	<br>
	 A framework essentially defines how you should accomplish a task.
	<br>
	 A framework gives you a structure to use as a starting point and customize.

<summary><strong>Planning a Program Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>What is the result of writing pseudocode for a program?</strong>
    <br>
    an outline for your program
    <br>
    Pseudocoding helps you create a basic outline for the program youâ€™re creating. With pseudocode, you can begin to describe the structure of your program.

    <summary><strong>Input and Output Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>Which is an example of output?</strong>
    <br>
    saving data to a file
    <br>
    Output is where a program sends data once it has accomplished its work with the data.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why might you display statements for the user indicating when processing starts and when output is complete?</strong>
    <br>
    if you want to let the user know where in the process the program is when a program takes a long time to run
    <br>
    Without feedback to the user, it can be unclear if a program is still working or has already finished.

    <summary><strong>Debugging Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>What is the goal of creating test cases?</strong>
    <br>
    to test all the possible cases that my code could encounter when it's used
    <br>
    A robust set of test cases should include tests for all the possible cases that your program could encounter.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What's the name of the IDE feature that finishes keywords or constructions for you after you start typing them?</strong>
    <br>
    autocompletion: Autocompletion literally offers to autocomplete your code when it thinks it recognizes what you're trying to type.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which strategy can help you debug a program when it does not generate errors in the interpreter??</strong>
    <br>
    Think through your code from the computer's point of view.
    <br>
    A bug that doesn't result in an error message requires you to think about how the computer is viewing your code in order to understand what's going wrong.

    <summary><strong>OOP Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>Why aren't all possible methods made available to every object?</strong>
    <br>
    to avoid overloading computer memory with unneeded methods
    <br>
    If all objects had access to all methods in the language, your programs would need more computer memory.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>When do you need to use an object-oriented approach to coding?</strong>
    <br>
    when you start building bigger projects with more complex code
    <br>
    Object-oriented code is a strategy that helps you organize code when it starts to feel needlessly complex.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is the object-oriented programming term for something that an object can do?</strong>
    <br>
    a method: Each object has behaviors, which are built using methods.

    <summary><strong>Advanced Topics Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>What is it called when a compiler keeps track of which items in memory are no longer needed and deletes them automatically?</strong>
    <br>
    garbage collection (Many common languages support garbage collection, which allows you to create programs without thinking about managing memory.)
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What's an advantage of using multithreading?</strong>
    <br>
    It can make your computer programs faster and more responsive.
    <br>
    Structuring your code to do multiple things at once can increase a program's speed and responsiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which is the best description of what an algorithm is?</strong>
    <br>
    a set of instructions that describes how to get the exact result you want
    <br>
    Computers don't know how to accomplish a multistep process without a programmer explaining step-by-step how to do it.
