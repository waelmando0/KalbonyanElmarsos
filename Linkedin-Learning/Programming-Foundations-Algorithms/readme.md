    <summary><strong>What are algorithms?</strong></summary>
    <strong>Algorithm: </strong>a set of instructions that describes how to get the exact result you want
    <br>
    The purpose of an algorithm is to solve a specific problem with a sequential set of steps
    <br>

                    <strong>Serial/Parallel</strong>
                    some algorithms work on their data sets in sequential fashion, which means that they are serial in nature.
                    <br>
                    Whereas a parallel algorithm can break up a data set into smaller pieces and then work on each simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>exact/approximate</strong>
                    An algorithm can be exact, in which case it produces a known predictable value.
                    <br>
                    or it can be approximate, in which case, it tries to find an answer that might or might not be exact.
                    <br>
                    For example, a facial recognition algorithm might not give the same answer every single time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>deterministic/non-deterministic</strong>
                    algorithms can be deterministic, in which case it executes each step with an exact decision.
                    <br>
                    or it could be non-deterministic, in which it attempts to produce a solution using successive guesses.
                    <br>
                    which become more accurate over time.

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Example: Euclid's Algorithm</strong>
    <br>
    Find the greatest common denominatore (GCD) of two integats:
    <br>
    Example: GCD of 20 and 8 is 4
    <br>
    (because 8 / 4 is 2; and 20 / 4 is 5)
    <br>
    <br>
    1. For two integers a and b where a > b divide a by b
    <br>
    1. If the remainder, r is 0 then stop: GCD is b
    <br>
    1. Otherwise set a to b, b to r and repeat at step 1 untile r is 0
    <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>GCD (20, 8)</strong></td>
        </tr>

def gcd(a, b):
    while (b != 0):
        t = a
        a = b
        b = t % b

    return a

print(gcd(60, 96))
print(gcd(20, 8))
```
<br>

```
let's try to figure out how this algorithm worked in the followed example:
print(gcd(60, 96))
--state =>   a = 60 ,  b = 96
  1- assign t to a   meaning t = 60
  2- assign a to b   meaning a = 96
  3- assign b to the reminder of divide t by b
  meaning  b = 60 % 96  =>  60
--state a = 96 , b = 60
  1- assign t to a   meaning t = 96
  2- assign a to b   meaning a = 60
  3- assign b to the reminder of divide t by b
  meaning  b = 96 % 60  =>  36
--state =>  a = 60 , b = 36
  1- assign t to a   meaning t = 60
  2- assign a to b   meaning a = 36
  3- assign b to the reminder of divide t by b
  meaning  b = 60 % 36  =>  24
--state => a= 36 , b = 24
  1- assign t to a   meaning t = 36
  2- assign a to b   meaning a = 24
  3- assign b to the reminder of divide t by b
  meaning  b = 36 % 24  =>  12
--state =>  a = 24 , b = 12
  1- assign t to a   meaning t = 24
  2- assign a to b   meaning a = 12
  3- assign b to the reminder of divide t by b
  meaning  b = 24 % 12  =>  0
--state => a = 12 , b = 0
Now we return the a   which is 12

     a collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key data structure is a collection with defined way of accessing and sorting items
    <ul>
        <li>Collection of elements identified by index or key</li>
        Arrays in most languages start their indexes at zero for the first element
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Array Operation</strong>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate item index: O(1)</li>

    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Collections of data elements, called nodes</li>
        <li>Contain reference to the next node in the list</li>
        <li>Hold whatever data the application needs</li>
        <li>Elements can be easily inserted and removed</li>
        <li>Underlying memory doesn't need to be reorganized</li>
        <li>Can't do constant-time random item access</li>
        <li>Item loopup is linear in time complexity (O(n))</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>node:contains data and a pointer to the next node the first item you add to the list called the head</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>singly linked list:</strong>each item has point to the next item in the list
    <br>
    <strong>Doubly linked list::</strong> each item in the list has two pointers to the next and previous element</details>

    <summary><strong>Stacks and queues</strong></summary>
    <strong>Stacks</strong>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Stack: Collection that supports push and pop operation</li>
        <li>The Last item pushed is the first one popped</li>
        <li>last in first out</li>
        <li>It follow the  LIFO  rule </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Ÿçtacks are great for programs where you need to reverse things
    <br>
    Stacks are also good for keeping track of state as things are pushed on and popped off the stacks

# Push items onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)
stack.append(4)

# Print the stack contents
print(stack)

# pop an item off the stack

```
# try out the python queue functions
from collections import deque

# create a new empty deque object that will functions as a queue
queue = deque()

# add some items onto the queue
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)

    <summary><strong>Hash Tables</strong></summary>
    <strong>Hash tables</strong> associative arrays
    <br>
    it's a data structure that maps keys to their associated values, and it does this using what's calle a hash function, this function uses the key to compute an index into the slots that are in the hash table and map the key to the value
    <br>
    <strong>Hash Tables Advantages</strong>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Every item have a key</li>
        <li>Key-to-value mappings are unique</li>
        <li>Hash tables are typically very fast</li>
        <li>For small datasets, arrays are usally more efficient</li>
        <li>Hash tables don't order entries in a predictable way</li>
        <li>Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Hash Tables Cons</strong>
    <br>
    for small datasets, arrays are usually more efficient hash tables don't order entries in predictable way

```
# create a hashtable all at once
items1 = dict({"key": 1, "key2" : 2, "key3" : "three"})
print(items1)

# create a hashtable progressively
items2 = {}
items2["key1] = 1
items2["key2] = 2
items2["key3] = 3
print(items2)

# try to access a nonexistent key
# print(items1["key6"])

# replace an item
items2["key2"] = "two"
print(items2)

# iterate the keys and values in the dictionary
for key, value in items2.item():
    print("key: ", key, " Value: ", value)
```

### Recursion
<details>
    <summary><strong>Understanding recursion</strong></summary>
    <strong>Recursion:</strong> is when a function call itself
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Recursive function need to have a breaking condition</li>
        <li>This prevents infinite loops and eventual crashes</li>
        <li>Each time the function is called, the old arguments are saved</li>
        <li>This is called the  "call stack"</li>
    </ul>

```
With a sorted list, we can perform a type of search is called a binary search. So, let's
imagine we had a list of sorted numbers, and the number that we're searching for is the number
41. To perform the binary search, we start off with two indexes at the beginning and end of
the list, and then we calculate the midpoint of the list, rounded down in case of an uneven
division, and then we check to see if that value at the midpoint is the value that we want, and if it is, then great, we return that index. Now, if the number at that index is less than the one that we're searching for, we know that we can ignore all the numbers below that index, and conversely if that number is larger than the one we're looking for, we can ignore
all the numbers above that index. So, now we calculate the new midpoint by advancing, in
this case, the lower index up the middle we just calculated, and then we compute the new
midpoint from there. So now, the lower becomes three, the upper stays where it is, and then  new midpoint becomes five, after rounding down the division. And this process repeats until we found the number which, in our example, is at index number five.
