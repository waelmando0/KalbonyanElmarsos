    <strong>An algorithm that takes eight times longer to operate on a data set that is twice as large is said to be _____ in time.</strong>
    <br>
    cubic
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>An algorithm that is deterministic _____.</strong>
    <br>
    always produces the same outputs from a given set of inputs
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which classifications apply to Euclid's algorithm for finding the least common denominator?</strong>
    <br>
    exact and deterministic
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which algorithm type derives a new set of data from an existing set of data?</strong>
    <br>
    a computational algorithm
    <br>
    A computational algorithm uses calculations to derive and output new data from another set of input data.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>The measurement of algorithm performance is dependent on which criteria?</strong>
    <br>
    the input data
    <br>
    The measurement of performance for an algorithm is dependent on the input data and varies as the input size grows.
    <br>
    <br>
