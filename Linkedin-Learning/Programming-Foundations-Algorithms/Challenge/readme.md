    <summary><strong>Overview Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>An algorithm that takes eight times longer to operate on a data set that is twice as large is said to be _____ in time.</strong>
    <br>
    cubic
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>An algorithm that is deterministic _____.</strong>
    <br>
    always produces the same outputs from a given set of inputs
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which classifications apply to Euclid's algorithm for finding the least common denominator?</strong>
    <br>
    exact and deterministic
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which algorithm type derives a new set of data from an existing set of data?</strong>
    <br>
    a computational algorithm
    <br>
    A computational algorithm uses calculations to derive and output new data from another set of input data.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>The measurement of algorithm performance is dependent on which criteria?</strong>
    <br>
    the input data
    <br>
    The measurement of performance for an algorithm is dependent on the input data and varies as the input size grows.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is the purpose of an algorithm?</strong>
    <br>
    to solve a specific problem with a sequential set of steps
    <br>
    An algorithm is used to solve a specific problem by following a sequential set of steps.

    <strong>What benefit does a linked list provide?</strong>
    <br>
    underlying memory does not need to be contiguous
    <br>
    The underlying memory that holds any node data does not need to be contiguous for a linked list.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What criteria allows algorithms to execute efficiently?</strong>
    <br>
    the scenario and available data structure types
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>In the example linear array, how are the elements referenced using index values? </strong>
    <br>
    0,1,2,3,4
    <br>
    Elements in an array are referenced by index values, typically starting at 0.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why are hash tables favored over arrays or linked lists?</strong>
    <br>
    They are faster for item lookups.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Why are linked lists sometimes preferred over arrays?</strong>
    <br>
    Why are linked lists sometimes preferred over arrays?
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>According to the code snippet below, which element will be removed from the queue?</strong>
    <br>
    1
    <br>
    A queue uses a first-in, first-out approach. Since element 1 is added first, it is the first to be removed with the pop instruction.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Stacks are _____ data structures.</strong>
    <br>
    last in, first out
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How does a hash table map index values to data values?</strong>
    <br>
    Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value.
    <br>
    A hash table is an associative array where a hash function uses a key to compute an index value and to map to the data value.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which data structure is most analogous to a dictionary?</strong>
    <br>
    a hash table
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What does the below code do, when working with a linked list?</strong>
    <br>

```
1 new_node = Node(data)
2 new_node.set_next(self.head)
3 self.head = new_node
4 self.count += 1
```
It add a new node and makes it the head of the list.
<br>
When a new value (node) is inserted in a linked list, the head can point to the new node by using the self.head = new_node code.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which data structure operation would be used for an “undo” command?</strong>
    <br>
    a stack using last-in, first-out
    <br>
    A stack is useful in providing backtracking features such as an undo button. An undo button would process the last command used as the first to undo.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How many elements are in an 8 by 3 by 2 array?</strong>
    <br>
    48
