<details>
    <summary><strong>Understanding Web Services</strong></summary>
    <strong>Which communication mechanism has a more lightweight architecture?</strong>
    <br>
    APIs
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What does authorization mean in terms of web service security?</strong>
    <br>
    what a user can do
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which status code is returned when the user is not authorized to call a web service?</strong>
    <br>
    401
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is one common alternative to web services?</strong>
    <br>
    library
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What are the two most common concerns when using web services?</strong>
    <br>
    latency and partial failures
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What feature allows the service provider and the service client to be written in different programming languages?</strong>
    <br>
    language transparency
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What does the use of web service reduce in order to deliver more powerful applications?</strong>
    <br>
    development time
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Which is a common web language used to transfer data?</strong>
    <br>
    XML
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Who are the two parties that typically interact when using web services?</strong>
    <br>
    client and server

    <summary><strong>Using RESTful APIs and HATEOAS</strong></summary>
    <strong>HATEOAS supports sending boolean fields along with state-related information.</strong>
    <br>
    FALSE
    <br>
    The primary advantage of HATEOAS is to avoid sending boolean fields or state-related fields that require the client to interpret them and decide what action(s) can be taken next.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>How is the core principle of HATEOAS achieved?</strong>
    <br>
    publication of links
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>RESTful APIs promote tight coupling.</strong>
    <br>
    FALSE
    <br>
    RESTFul APIs promote loose-coupling. This simply means that the system should be designed so that changes and enhancements to web services donâ€™t break clients that are already using them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is the term used to describe data sent back and forth?</strong>
    <br>
    payload
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Resources can be manipulated using an unlimited set of operations.</strong>
    <br>
    FALSE
    <br>
    Resources can only be manipulated using a fixed set of operations.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What should the interaction between the client and server be?</strong>
    <br>
    stateless

    <summary><strong>Using SOAP-Based WEb Services Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>SOAP is preferred for high security and/or complex transactions.</strong>
    <br>
    TRUE
    <br>
    SOAP is used for enterprise level web services that require high security and/or complex transactions.
    <br>
    <strong>What does the acronym WSDL stand for?</strong>
    <br>
    Web Services Description Language
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is one quality of ACID compliance?</strong>
    <br>
    consistency

    <summary><strong>Developing APIs Using GraphQL Quiz</strong></summary>
    <strong>Just like SOAP and REST APIs, Graph QL returns a rigid structure of data back to client.</strong>
    <br>
    FALSE
    <br>
    Unlike regular SOAP or REST APIs, GraphQL gives you the ultimate flexibility in being able to specify in your API requests specifically what data you need and get back exactly that.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>When using GraphQL, which defines a set of types?</strong>
    <br>
    schema
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Data cannot be changed using GraphQL.</strong>
    <br>
    FALSE
    <br>
    Besides query, there are two other operation types: mutation, which modifies server-side data, and subscription, which allows for notification of changes to data in realtime.
